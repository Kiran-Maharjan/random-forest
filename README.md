Python notebook, sophisticated machine learning model, the Random Forest

The random forest uses many trees, and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree. It generally has much better predictive accuracy than a single decision tree and it works well with default parameters. If you keep modeling, you can learn more models with even better performance, but many of those are sensitive to getting the right parameters.
There are parameters which allow you to change the performance of the Random Forest much as we changed the maximum depth of the single decision tree. But one of the best features of Random Forest models is that they generally work reasonably even without this tuning.
